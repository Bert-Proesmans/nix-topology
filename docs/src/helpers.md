# Helpers

You will probably find yourself in a situation where you want to add multiple external devices to
your topology. You can of course just define new nodes for them manually, but there are some
helper functions that you can use to quickly define switches, routers or other external devices (for example "The Internet").

These helpers are available under `config.lib.topology`, regardless of whether you are within a
topology module, or a NixOS modules.
